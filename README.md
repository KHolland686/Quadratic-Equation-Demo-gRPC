# Quadratic-Equation-Demo-gRPC

Contains a Python implementation of a Quadratic Equation Solver utilizing the gRPC framework. 
Features a client-server architecture where the client sends a request with the coefficients of a quadratic equation to the server, which then computes the solutions and returns them to the client.

## Usage

To use the Quadratic Equation Solver, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (Python, gRPC).
3. Start the server by running the `Quadratic_Server.py` script.
4. To change the coefficients for the quadratic equation being solved, in the client script `Quadratic_Client.py` change the values set for variables a, b and c
5. Run the client script `Quadratic_Client.py`
